# UMD player does not play games

### If UMD spins
 - Gently clean the lens with a cloth. Blow out any dust near the lens with dry air.
 - If cleaning isn't enough, you might consider replacing the entire drive. The task is quite complicated, the UMD cover as well as the spring are quite capricious to disassemble if you don't have the cost of a hand.
### Else
 - The PSP has a lever/push button to check that the cover closes and checks that there is play in the drive. It may be that one of them is broken and no longer makes contact. In this case the repair is complicated you will have to resolder a button, or change the motherboard.


# Black screen after installing a "new" screen

Some new screens (from Aliexpress by experience) just don't work. If you break the screen even lit it and not our new screen, it means that this new screen is not functional.


# PSP 1000 sound only works if I plug something into the jack

You have just proudly turned your PSP back on after reassembling it, and you realize that the sound only works through the speakers when you plug in a jack device. Infact not all sound cards are compatible with all PSP 1000s. You just installed an incompatible sound card. You must re-change your are card with a compatible card. (I mean by card are, the card that manages the sound, the wifi, and the memory stick)


# PSP Works only on Batterie

Your PSP only works if you put a battery already charged in it. The PSP no longer recharges and no longer works on mains. In this case the repair is quite complicated. Very often one of the fuses that manages the power supply is dead. It can be tricked into trying (with a trusted power supply). Then replace the fuse if you are sure of the source of the problem.

(A detailed explanation of targeted fuses is coming soon.)

# PSP does not start and no LEDs light up

First, try changing the card with the start button and the cable that connects it to the motherboard. If this is not enough consider the following solution.

If you don't have another PSP to charge the battery, you can't tell this problem from the present problem. "PSP Works only on Batterie" (The fuse may be different in this case)

In this case the repair is quite complicated. Very often one of the fuses that manages the power supply is dead. He may have to try (with a trusted power supply). Then replace the fuse if you are sure of the source of the problem.

(A detailed explanation of targeted fuses is coming soon.)

# The Cross, Square, Triangle, Circle and R keys no longer work

At first on the PSP 1000 try to change the connection cable, as well as the electronic card of the buttons (the one which also manages power). For the 2000/3000 simply change the connection pad that encloses the buttons.

If this is not enough, your problem comes from your Motherboard. I think it's possible to fix it by replacing a fuse, but I haven't done any further research on that.

# The menu display is broken

I noticed on certain PSP 1000 in 6.61 (i don't know if the problem is unique to the 1000 on 6.61) that certain theme colors are displayed incorrectly in the list and when they are applied the display of the menu is completely broken. Go back to a color that works to fix the problem (not by mouth).
